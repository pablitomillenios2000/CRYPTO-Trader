# PURPOSE

This Script uses an advanced Plotting Library that uses the GPU for faster processing to process millions of exact data from Crypto Currency that can be as fine as minute-exact data over the course of many years

Normal libraries like chart.js fail to compute this in reasonable time and offer only a blank screen

This script can simulate the following strategy

=> Exit at a stop-loss
=> Re-entry at a local maximum or minimum

do this millions of times

This increases the returns of a crypto investment by around 1 order of magnitude !!!
